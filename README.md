# ae504
This is a code for comparing different algorithms to solve the lunar lander problem. The algorithms simulated are:
1. Monte Carlo
2. Q-Learning
3. DQN
4. SARSA


To run the code `python autopilot.py 10000 models/*/qnetwork_2000.pt`

To track the lunar lander and the final path traversed `python main.py`
